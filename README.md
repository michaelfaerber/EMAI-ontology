# The Energy Measurement of AI Models Ontology
Modeling AI systems' characteristics of energy consumption and their sustainability level as an extension of the FAIR data principles has been considered only rudimentarily. In this work, we propose an **ontology for modeling the energy consumption and other environmental aspects of AI models**. We evaluate our ontology based on competency questions.

Our ontology is available at **http://w3id.org/EMAI/ontology**

It can be used in a variety of scenarios, ranging from an improved research data management to strategic controlling of institutions and implementation of standards.
